# Resty

## Lab Requirements

Students will be creating and styling a Counter application. Look for the following attributes

- `Header`, `Footer`, and `Counter` components to separate files
- Properly `export` them as defaults
- Import them into the `App` Component using ES6 `import` statement
- Proper state management
- Button Handlers
  - Bonus if they can wire both buttons with one handler

### Grading Standards & Notes

- Features
  - As noted

  - Not Required
- Deployment

- Documentation
  - Quality README

### Lab Assistance Notes

- The first and most important part of the lab assignment is to draw a process diagram of the starter code and state as events happen. Once the students understand that, they can move on.

```js
git clone
